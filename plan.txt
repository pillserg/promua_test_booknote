 + basic structure
 + basic config and app code
 + basic models
    + Users
    + Books 
        (M2M)
    + Authors
    (No user permissions and user 2 books relations for simplicity every authorized user can edit delete data)
 + basic views and templates
    + index (add pagination here - it'll be implemented somewhere down the road)
    + books list
    + authors list
 + login/logout support for users flask-login (through openID (I think restricted to Google account))
 + simple data add (WTF)
 - delete
 - WTF forms for editing data
 - Search
 - m2m addition from books add edit through http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/ should be ok.
 - make pretty and more UF
    - some styling 
    - upgrade crud in UI to AJAX
 - initialization/managment script (makefile will do nice)
